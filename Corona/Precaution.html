                        <h2>Hand-washing</h2>
                        <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; People should use plenty of soap and water to wash their hands for at least 20 seconds, especially after:
                            traveling on public transport
                            being in a public place
                            coughing,
                            sneezing,
                            blowing their nose
                            &emsp;&emsp;If a person is not able to use soap and water, they can use a hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.
                            Washing the hands with soap or hand sanitizer helps kill any viruses on the hands that people may have come into contact with.

                    <div> <h2>Avoiding touching the face</h2>
                    <p>People should avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth with their hands, especially if they are unwashed. This can help limit the spread of germs and reduce the likelihood of them getting sick.
                        The hands come into contact with several surfaces throughout the day, and they may pick up viruses this way. A new report suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can remain on certain surfaces for up to 3 days.
                If a person then touches their face, viruses can transfer to the eyes, nose, or mouth and enter the body.</p></div>

                    <div> <h2>Social Distancing </h2>
                        <p>
                            Social distancing remains a key way to mitigate spread. 
                            The CDC recommends maintaining a distance of approximately 6 feet from others in public places since respiratory droplets produced by coughing or sneezing do not travel more than 6 feet.
                             While at home, remind everyone to practice everyday preventive actions – such as washing hands and wiping down surfaces – to help reduce the risk of getting sick.
                              If you are symptomatic and have tested positive for COVID-19 but do not require hospitalization, 
                              you should stay in a specific “sick room” and away from other people in your home as much as possible and use a separate bathroom, if available. 
                             If your living space makes it difficult to keep a 6-foot distance, stay as far apart as you can and continue to practice good hygiene and wear a mask.

                    <div><h2>Wear Mask</h2>
                    <p>
                        On April 3, the CDC changed its guidelines on face masks, recommending that people wear cloth face coverings in public settings.
                         This is especially encouraged in situations where social distancing is difficult to maintain (such as in a grocery store or pharmacy) and in areas of significant community-based transmission. 
                         According to the CDC, studies have shown that individuals with the novel coronavirus could be asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic, prompting them to make this new recommendation. While this measure is intended to help mitigate the spread,
                          it’s important to note that it does not replace social distancing recommendations. In addition, surgical masks and N-95 respirators should remain reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.
